/**
 * Contains tests for VMODL2 names (or identifiers).
 * <p>
 * The VMODL2 specification is based on Java syntax, so we rely on Java
 * naming conventions for our type and member names.  However, a VMODL2
 * model is only a metamodel and it is always transformed into a more
 * concrete form, such as a language binding.  Each target language has
 * its own naming convention, which is often not the same as Java/VMODL2.
 * Therefore, every target language needs to be prepared to translate
 * names to their naming convention and, further, to be ready to handle
 * possible conflicts that might happen with their language keywords.
 * <p>
 * The examples here are meant to test the proper code generation and
 * use for a target language.
