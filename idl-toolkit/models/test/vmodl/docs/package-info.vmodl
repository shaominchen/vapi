 * The VMODL2 specification relies on Javadoc for our means of documenting
 * the API.  However, VMODL2 constrains the markup and javadoc tags used,
 * in order to control the abstract doc model produced, which is then
 * transformed to concreate syntax for each target language.
 * The examples herein are meant to drive the testing of documentation
 * processing by language toolkits.
