/**
 * Contains tests for resource annotations.
 * <p>
 * The resource annotations consist of the following:
 * <dl>
 *  <dd> {@literal @Resource}
 *   <dt> This marker associates any element of type {@code ID} to be
 *   of the given resource type.  It may be declared directly on any
 *   element of type {@code ID} or, as a convenience, it may be declared
 *   on a containing class or interface.  In the latter case, it implies
 *   a default resource type for any {@code ID} contained therein (unless
 *   explicitly overridden.)
 *  <dd> {@literal @IsOneOf({"foo", "bar"})}
 *   <dt> This annotation is used to constrain a polymorphic resource.
 *  <dd> {@literal @SymbolTableOnly}
 *   <dt> This marker is often used on an interface that strictly exists
 *   to declare resource type constants.  In this case, the constants
 *   are symbols for the compiler only and they will be replaced by the
 *   literal value when producing the IDL model.
 * </dl>
