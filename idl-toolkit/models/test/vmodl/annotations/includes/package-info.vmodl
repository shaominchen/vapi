 * Contains tests for annotations that enable including structures
 * in other structures (a more literal form of composition.)
 * <p>
 * The <i>include</i> annotations consist of the following:
 * <dl>
 *  <dd> {@literal @Includable}
 *   <dt> This marker declares a class to be includable by another.
 *   An error will be reported for attempting to include a class
 *   without this marker.
 *  <dd> {@literal @Include(Foo.class)}
 *   <dt> This annotation includes the specified class in this one,
 *   where {@code Foo.class} is a reference to a class that is marked
 *   as includable.
 *  <dd> {@literal @HasFieldsOf(Foo.class)}
 *   <dt> This annotation constrains an element (field, parameter or
 *   method result) of type {@code DynamicStructure}, such that it
 *   must contain the field of the given type
 * </dl>
